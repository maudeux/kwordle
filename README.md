Played Wordle so much, I ended up with my own version.

Built with **JavaScript**

## Rules are simple 
- Guess a 5 letter word
- Tiles change colour based on how well (or not) your guess is

  - Green: Correct position
  - Yellow: Incorrect position
  - Gray: Letter is not found in the word

- You only get 5 tries instead of 6, but you can replay as much as you like :)
